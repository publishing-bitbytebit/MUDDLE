Yea, you right. We all just animals.
Why be wild'N tho, I prefer to be woke.
I just wanted real. Just wanted natural.
Not cookie cutter crackers - propped up in panes stoned.
Vibrant, vivacious, vivid, and easy. 
The kind of good lovin that comes from us vibin.
My kind of loving it just comes...
Instinctively.
NO show, finesse, or games 'cause you playing me. 
Just want some real, but I guess you ain't anything more
than an "aminal snack" found at the dollar tree store.
