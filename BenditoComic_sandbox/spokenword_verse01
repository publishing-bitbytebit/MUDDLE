Yea, you right. We all just animals.
We mostly be wild'N tho I prefer to be woke.
Just wanted real. Just wanted natural.
Not cookie cutter crackers - propped up in panes.
Stoned.
Vibrant, vivacious, vivid, and easy. 
The kind of good lovin that comes so...
Instinctively.
No convincing, finessing, or plotting to get me back. 
I won't be caught licking a dolla tree "aminal snack".
Touched and fondled with anyone's hands 
Nothing is special, nothing name-brand.
