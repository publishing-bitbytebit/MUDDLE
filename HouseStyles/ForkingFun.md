# A HOW-TO GUIDE: C{ustomized][reator] FORKS  
  
First, *clone MUDDLE*. In the top right corner of the main MUDDLE repo. select the `FORK` button.  
    
![fork button](https://github.com/taylorcate/MUDDLE/blob/master/PromotionalMaterials/WorkFlow/MUDDLEtoFORK.png)  

> _At the forefront of c{reat][aptur}ing collaborative art and c{aptur][reat}ing the process of said art - in [m]any iterations - building a community is vital. See all our FORKS here - https://github.com/publishing-bitbytebit/MUDDLE/network/members  

## Setting Up{1,2}Stream

Next, **commit to syncing your FORK to our upstream MUDDLE** by habituating either the [MUDDLE from Command Line workflow](https://github.com/taylorcate/MUDDLE/wiki/MUDDLE-from-Command-Line) or the [MUDDLE from GitHub Desktop workflow](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/). While creators are able to contribute files directly to their FORKS via GitHub the only ways currently available to properly sync up with the main MUDDLE repo are to use either the [GitHub Desktop GUI](https://desktop.github.com/) or command line.  

## Initializing Your Backyard and Neigh{BBoard][borhood
 
Once you have your FORK linked to upstream, head into the settings of your FORK and **add an issues, wiki, and projects board[s]**. 
  
While you are in your FORK's settings, check to **be sure your notifications are set to be notified of any activity on your FORK**. As others learn how muddling goes, We][They might need to reach out to learn more of your process[es].
  
The yolk of [y]our work will need to be created collaboratively - from start to end - so as you move your work from your personal devices into your online FORK, `@taylorcate` and `@rjp43` will need special collaborative access to help in case there are any big bugs along the way. In settings, you will see an option to **add collaborators** - go ahead and add us both, please. You might add other GitHub users if you intend for your FORK to be a collaborative effort beyond the MUDDLE editors' assistance. Â¡ALL in growing the neigh{BBoard][borhood!

### Personal Project Boards

On the main MUDDLE repo. you will notice that every artist identified in the sandbox has a project board under ["Projects"](https://github.com/taylorcate/MUDDLE/projects). MUDDLE editors assign a creator's project label to pull requests, commits, and issues thus populating the creator's project boards. The Creator pro{file][ject}s link together all of a creator's contributions to the main MUDDLE repo in one centralized location. **We suggest individual creators use their "Projects" boards as places to organize all of the commits and issues for each piece of conten][ar}t.** So, ideally, a creator will create a new project for each of piece of content and assign commits and issues to each piece of art by linking to the project board.
  
### Creator's Community Issues Board  

**Creator's should think of their FORK's issues board as the primary place MUDDLE][edito}rs can directly reach out with c{ontent][reator] specific qu][sugg}estions.** Personally workshoping your muddle in your own backyard in turn keeps the upstream MUDDLE backyard available for larger community d{evelopment][iscussion}s. Upon your invitation to collaborate, MUDDLE][edito}rs can customize the discussion of process and production {in your backyard|on your issues board}. Not only does this allow a more focused workshopping space for each individual creator these steps also act as our safety net in keeping the upstream MUDDLE not "too muddled" for new neighbors. ALSO this ensures your "process to production" is fully documented singularly as one indivdual creator. It will be up to the Editors - in moving the b{y][i}t[e]s during MUDDLE_mag production - to incorporate individual creator's backayrd conversations to the mag's community record as it becomes necessary to represent the processes of those creators accepted to the annual Spring publication.   

### Custom Labels, Tags, and Repo. Description  

COMING SOON!

### README too!
Invite [neighbors](https://github.com/publishing-bitbytebit/MUDDLE/network/members) to your content by sharing **unique README.md files for each of your works** - _See [Mastering Markdown Resource](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and [GitHub Basic Writing and Formatting Resource](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)_. Let the community know where to find your other versions of self (social media, works published elsewhere, etc.) by creating **a README.md file in your "creator-named" folder in the sandbox with your creator details**.
