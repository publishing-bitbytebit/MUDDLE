Scene unfolds... starts off with in my dreams/  
& I see ghost.... when I shouldn't be/  
Feels so cold... but that maeks life intresting/  
Things unfold.... End different from you & me/  
***  
Can I reach the stars??? Travelin down this yellow/  
Road, as if it where Oz they say I'm the one/  
I guess thats why I'm feelin odd/  
These demons steady schemin for no reason oh my GOD!/(SIGH)  
I'm on one like I'm standin on a dollar bill/  
& I don't gotta pop a bottle or alot of pills/  
They ~~insucure~~ insecure & think they winnin cuz they got a mill~~ion~~/  
That's just revealin for a villian cuz I gotta steal/  
Skills tippin off the scale talented as hell/  
They rather see me in a cell but ain't got time to kill/  
So far off in left field I'm in another realm/  
Light years away that I can't be swayed to follow them/  
I got my own desire with my eyes on an enterprise/  
Which is why it wide as what lies in between her thighes/  
We just your modern day super villians don't be superised/  
KNOW NO OTHER Signing get minimized/  
***  
From the beginning when I wasn't winnin' no one care at all/  
~~Now~~ ~~I'm~~ gritting'pockets poppeye spinach call me ball hog/  
~~Every~~ ~~headed~~ Was in the right direction then suddenly vearing off/  
~~I~~ Now I'm seeing things more clearer than I ever did before/  
Drowning from repentance reachin for light in the distance/  
Cinderblockin' my chakra got me sleepin with the fishes/  
Defenseless, procuter with not witness/  
Handin' ~~out~~ more sentences then slaves got lunches/  
i wonder, as fellow prisoners get held for detention/  
If ~~the~~  tention cuts ~~is~~ thick enough to hold the whole demention/  
Big homie Sool got 15 to life on the plea/  
Fighting for his right but keeps it cool ~~like~~ ~~a~~ ~~G~~ with G.O.D./  
~~Things~~ apparent turn transparent ~~almost~~ impossible to see/  
With the naked ~~&~~ eye but in the mind ~~it's~~ there's an infiniti/  
Of endless possibilities ~~pushin~~ ~~up~~ ~~on~~ ~~Keneddy~~  tryin to touch the shore/  
From concrete jail cells to fancy marble on the floor/  
Everyone's ~~is~~ ~~diversed~~ different ~~so~~ ~~it~~ makes sense we all don't get along/  
Collective ~~concerns~~ politics insist ~~that~~ we're wrongfully informed/  
It's time to storm, guns drawn, blazin for a new dawn/  
Even a king could be ~~seen as~~ the form of a pawn word is born/  
~~I'm~~ WE'RE here to monopolize with a crew of important guys/  
Who only think profit - wise & rise like the ocean tide/  
If you tryin to jepordise I can't promise you'll stay alive/  
Since you ~~dyin~~ tryin to make a name ~~you~~ ~~can~~ ~~try~~ die by an open flame/  
To blame when we seperated ourselves into classes/  
When at the end of the day we all the same color asshes/
